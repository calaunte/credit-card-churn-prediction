# Credit Card Churn Prediction

This repository is dedicated to the "Credit Card Churn Prediction" project as part of the course on "Feature Selection, Model Selection, and Tuning." The goal is to predict customer churn for a credit card service, identifying not only whether a customer is likely to discontinue the service but also understanding the underlying reasons.

## Project Overview

In an industry where acquiring a new customer is often more costly than retaining an existing one, understanding why customers choose to leave is critical. This project utilizes customer data to build a predictive model focused on customer churn. The model's insights will aid in proactively addressing customer's needs, potentially turning a decision to leave into continued engagement.

### Objectives

1. **Data Analysis**: Dive deep into the dataset to understand the various factors influencing customer decisions regarding credit card services.
2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Identify and select significant features that contribute to a customer's likelihood to churn.
3. **Model Development and Tuning**: Build a predictive model using appropriate algorithms and enhance its performance by tuning hyperparameters.
4. **Interpretation**: Analyze model results to understand why customers are churning and propose actionable strategies for customer retention.

### Prerequisites

- Fundamental knowledge of machine learning, feature selection, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Environment set up with Python and necessary libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).
